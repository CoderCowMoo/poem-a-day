# poem-a-day
Name originally came from idea to give the user a random poem every day, but this just gives a random poem using the poetry.org api. Very thankful to them for hosting a free API like that.

This is also my first Go program. Taught me io buffer handling, package management, json unmarshling, Go data types and structures, and more as can be seen in the program.
